## Terminal Web Application

### Getting Started

1. `git clone --recursive git@github.com:FlyHomes/terminal-web.git` (Clone the repository recursively)
2. `cd terminal-web` (Make sure you are at the root of the directory)
3. `yarn install` (Get all the third party libraries)
4. `yarn start` (Run the app on localhost:3000)

Note: Please make sure your node version is >=12.18.3.

If js-commons is not initialized, run the following in the terminal web folder:
1. `git submodule init`
2. `git submodule update`

### Testing
`yarn test` will start a test server, which will run the tests for you as you add/change more.
